## Notes for QA Engineer

### Playwright MCP Integration

Each test file above should be created using Playwright's page testing API:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('US-1: User self-registration with role selection', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test steps here
})
```

### Common Test Patterns

1. **Auth tests**: Use seeded test users or register fresh users for each test
2. **Real-time tests**: Wait for SSE events or polling responses with appropriate timeouts
3. **Role-based tests**: Test each role independently and verify access control
4. **Data validation**: Test form validation errors and field constraints
5. **UI state**: Verify visual indicators (badges, status, counts) match data

### Environment Setup

- Test against a fresh MySQL database per test run (seed with baseline users)
- Use `TEST_ENV=test` to skip certain middleware or enable test mode if needed
- Clear notifications and data between test runs
- Use `page.goto()` with full URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/login`)

### Timeouts & Waits

- SSE events: wait up to 5 seconds
- API responses: wait up to 3 seconds
- Sound playback: verify via API call or mock (not the actual audio)
- Real-time updates: poll `/api/tickets` or check DOM for changes
